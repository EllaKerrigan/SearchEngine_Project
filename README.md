This Python project is a search engine that crawls Reddit posts and ranks them using the PageRank algorithm.
I used reddit topics that were of relevance to myself and my friends, which made it a fun project to take on.
The goal is to provide an example of web crawling, data processing, and search ranking.

Features:

1. Crawls Reddit Posts: Extracts posts and comments from specified subreddits.
2. PageRank Algorithm: Ranks posts based on their relevance and importance.
3. Search Functionality: Allows users to search for posts and view ranked results.

Requirements: 
1. PRAW (Reddit API) to crawl
2. BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content
3. Multiprocessing library to crawl multiple subreddits at once
4. Data Indexer (PyLucene)
5. Web Page Hoster (Django)
6. Database
